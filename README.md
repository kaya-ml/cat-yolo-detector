# Cat YOLO Detector

## Overview
This project is a cat image detection system built using YOLOv8 and Python.  
It was developed as a computer vision practice project to train a model capable of identifying individual cats from images.

The workflow includes dataset preparation, label verification, model training, and visual result confirmation.
